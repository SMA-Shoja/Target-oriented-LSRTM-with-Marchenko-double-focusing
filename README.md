Target-oriented LSRTM with Marchenko Double-Focusing

Purpose:  This MATLAB package efficiently calculates high-resolution images of a specific target area within a complex subsurface environment. It seamlessly integrates Least-Squares Reverse Time Migration (LSRTM) with advanced Marchenko double-focusing techniques to mitigate artifacts caused by overburden multiples.

How to Use:

Setup:

In JobSubmit.m, adjust the parameters to match your specific cluster configuration. Ensure your MATLAB environment is correctly configured for the cluster.

Customization:

Open TargetOrientedLSRTM.m.
Modify chapters 1 and 2 to input your own seismic data and subsurface model.

Important: This package requires your own data and model to function.
